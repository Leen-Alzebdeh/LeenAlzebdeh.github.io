Aspiring Software Developer in my fourth year of computing science at the University of Alberta.

Here are a few examples of my work:

✅ Worked as a developer for Zero RampUp as part of a team and created a fully functional website using JavaScript. <br>
✅ Worked as a Django backend developer to create a social network platform web app that is linked with other teams’ unique APIs and can aggregate activity from their web servers.  
✅ Trained, tuned, and deployed various machine learning (ML) models in PyTorch and TensorFlow. <br>
✅ Customized ML models, such as YOLOv5 and U-Net, to perform object detection and image segmentation. <br>
✅ Trained in AI and reinforcement learning algorithms, including A\* search, Q-learning, and heuristic search. <br>
✅ Developed and tested an Android social media app as a developer in a Scrum environment. <br>

𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 & 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀: React, Python, Java, Django, NumPy, PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, Pandas, Android, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker & AI technologies!

I get excited about opportunities where I'm able to work with highly creative teams to develop innovative solutions using the latest technology.
